- The coupled model was, however, unable to capture spatial gradients in nutrient limitation (Wang et al., 2021).
- To facilitate the use of the model in teaching environments and for users with limited technical support, it may be operated without any third-party software, as the input files consist of “namelist” (nml) text files for configuration and csv files for meteorological and flow time series data (Hipsey et al., 2019)

- The inability to predict peak flow accurately, even in an agricultural watershed (Najim et al., 2005)
- Inability to assess nutrient transformation and in-stream processes; thus, the model is capable of simulating only single events (Adu and Kumarasamy, 2018).
- One limitation of distributed models such as AGNPS is that preparation of input data files and interpretation of simulation results may become overwhelming and
time-consuming with increase in cell numbers (Tim and Jolly, 1994; Tim et al., 1995; Tim, 1996; Liao and Tim, 1997; Mankin et al., 2002).

- The values in SWAT(3S) are in better agreement with the
model results of previous studies in the catchment (Kiesel et al., 2010; Pfannerstill et al., 2014) than the values estimated by SWAT+.
- Few studies have investigated the use of SWAT+ for representing hydrological consequences of climate change (Pulighe et al., 2021).
- As with the original SWAT modeling code, SWAT+ simulates groundwater flow and aquifer-stream water exchange within the following constraints: groundwater head is controlled only by recharge and groundwater discharge to streams; groundwater flow to streams is based on the presence of a groundwater divide; groundwater flow
to streams is based on steady flow conditions; seepage from streams to the aquifer is not simulated; the groundwater in each aquifer is treated independently from adjacent aquifers; and each aquifer unit has homogeneous aquifer properties (Bailey et al., 2022). To overcome these limitations, Bailey et al. (2020a) introduced the gwflow module for SWAT+, which simulates groundwater storage, groundwater head, and resulting groundwater flow for unconfined groundwater systems in a physicallybased spatially-distributed manner (Bailey et al., 2022).","• QSWAT+, a QGIS interface for setting up your watershed (SWAT, n.d.)
